Morgan McGuire converted the PLY from Georgia Tech to IFS, and then computed vertex normals and wrote the result to OBJ format using custom code. This model is originally from the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository. It was scanned from a real object by a Cyberware 3030 MS scanner. The model reconstructed from scans by Stanford contains fewer triangles and more vertices. The Georgia Tech version may have been reconstructed independently from the original points. As with many models on this page, I report the vertex count after merging co-located vertices with the same normals during load (i.e., the size that your vertex buffer will actually be in memory), so my vertex count is lower than the one reported by Georgia Tech, but my face count is identical.
