# Method

## Model Simplification

CJW

SIGGRAPH

## One-pass Rasterization 

Single Input(simplified model) and Multiple Output(position maps from probe->merge into one map)

## Reconstruct Irradiance/Radiance Map

Based on position maps from probe and gbuffer from light

## Shading with Reconstructed Irradiance Map

Similar as method in Light Field Probe GI

## Parallel Texel Fetching

PYL

## Future Work

Glossy(non-mirror like) Effect
